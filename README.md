How to post-train a Open-source LLM with RL

## Setup

1. Install all packages except `flash-attn`, then all packages (`flash-attn` is weird)
```
uv sync --no-install-package flash-attn
uv sync
```

2. Run the required unit tests:

``` sh
uv run pytest tests/test_grpo.py
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).
